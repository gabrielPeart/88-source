/	File:  SYSSTDIO.C	Version:  01.09
/	---------------------------------------
/
/	Contents:	Function zyspr
/			Function zysrd
/
/	01.04	Removed usage of inpateof.  From disk files, OK to read
/		from file again and get EOF.  From console, OK to request
/		another line after EOF, if that is what user wants.  Makes
/		behavior of INPUT similar to behavior of TERMINAL.
/		MBE 12/24/87
/
/	01.05	Added getprfd() to provide current standard output fd to
/		osint.
/
/	01.06	Added sfn to report source file name to compiler.  Definition of sysrd EXIT 1
/		case expanded to handle both EOF and reporting of source file change.
/		Use of first_record expanded to provide initial source file name to compiler.
/
/	01.07	Added input/output record sizes to ioblocks.  Note, as a
/		result of changes in the compiler at ASG11, it is now
/		possible for zyspr() to be called from zysou().  Previously,
/		writes to OUTPUT were going through the PRTST logic, wasting
/		time using the print buffer, and limiting the record length
/		to the listing page width.  Instead, all output assignments
/		go to zysou(), which now uses the FCB info in WA to decide
/		if it is a special file (OUTPUT/TERMINAL), or a normal
/		file.
/
/	01.08	Add end of line characters to IOBLKs.  Add clrbuf().
/
/	01.09	New oswrite calling sequence.  01-Feb-93.

/*
/   sysstdio module
/
/   The sysstdio module contains two functions, zyspr and zysrd, that
/   perform standard input and output for the spitbol compiler.
/
/   During compilation zysrd is called to read lines of the program.  During
/   program execution zysrd is called to read input via input associated
/   variable INPUT.
/
/   During compilation zyspr is called to print header lines, the program
/   listing, and compilation statistics.  During program execution zyspr
/   is called to print output via output associated variable OUTPUT.
/
/   After program execution zyspr is called to print execution statistics
/   and the variable post-mortem dump if requested.

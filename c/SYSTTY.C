/	File:  SYSTTY.C		Version:  01.04
/	---------------------------------------
/
/	Contents:	Function zyspi
/			Function zysri
/
/ 01.02		Added output record size to ioblock.  Note, as a
/		result of changes in the compiler at ASG11, it is now
/		possible for zyspi() to be called from zysou().  Previously,
/		writes to TERMINAL were going through the PRTST logic, wasting
/		time using the print buffer, and limiting the record length
/		to the listing page width.  Instead, all output assignments
/		go to zysou(), which now uses the FCB info in WA to decide
/		if it is a special file (OUTPUT/TERMINAL), or a normal
/		file.
/
/ 01.03 06-Feb-91 Changed for read/write I/O.  Add EOL chars to ioblk.
/
/ 01.04 01-Feb-93 New oswrite calling sequence.
/
*/

/*
/   The systty module contains two functions, zyspi and zysri, that
/   perform terminal I/O.
/
/   During program execution assignment to variable TERMINAL causes a line
/   to be printed on the terminal.  A call is made to zyspi to actually
/   print the line.
/
/   During program execution a value reference to varible TERMINAL causes
/   a line to be read from the terminal.  A call is made to zysri to actually
/   read the line.
/
/   Under Un*x file descriptor 2 will be used for terminal access.

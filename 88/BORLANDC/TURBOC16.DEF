* Number of statements within which a jump will be shortened.  Derived
* empirically as follows for a specific Minimal program:
*
* Set JUMP_N to a large value, then translate and assemble program.
* The assembler will report a large number of jumps out of range.
* Reduce JUMP_N until the number of errors is small (<10), and enter
* those as special cases below.
*
* These definitions are for Minimal file V37.MIN and the 8088 code generator.

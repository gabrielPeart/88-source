*      SPITBOL CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY SYMBOLS FOR USE BY TOKEN.SPT
*      ---------------------------------------------------------
*
*      THIS FILE OF CONDITIONAL SYMBOLS WILL OVERRIDE THE CONDITIONAL
*      DEFINITIONS CONTAINED IN THE SPITBOL MINIMAL FILE.   IN ADDITION,
*      LINES BEGINNING WITH ">" ARE TREATED AS SPITBOL STATEMENTS AND
*      IMMEDIATELY EXECUTED.
*
*      FOR 16-BIT 8088 SPITBOL, WITH 16-BIT INTEGER ACCUMULATOR.
*
*      NOTE THAT THE 8088 IMPLEMENTATION _MUST_ DEFINE .CEPP AND
*      .CRPP.  BECAUSE THE MINIMAL CODE RUNS IN ANOTHER SEGMENT,
*      IT IS POSSIBLE AND PROBABLE THAT THERE WILL BE CODE
*      ADDRESSES GREATER THAN MXLEN.  THIS WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS
*      FOR THE GARBAGE COLLECTOR. USING THE ODD/EVEN TESTS AVOIDS
*      THESE ADDRESS COMPARISONS.
*
*      IN THE SPITBOL TRANSLATOR, THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONAL
*      ASSEMBLY SYMBOLS ARE REFERRED TO. TO INCORPORATE THE
*      FEATURES REFERRED TO, THE MINIMAL SOURCE SHOULD BE
*      PREFACED BY SUITABLE CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY SYMBOL
*      DEFINITIONS.
*      IN ALL CASES IT IS PERMISSIBLE TO DEFAULT THE DEFINITIONS
*      IN WHICH CASE THE ADDITIONAL FEATURES WILL BE OMITTED
*      FROM THE TARGET CODE.
*

*                            CONDITIONAL OPTIONS
*                            SINCE .UNDEF NOT ALLOWED IF SYMBOL NOT
*                            DEFINED, A FULL COMMENT LINE INDICATES
*                            SYMBOL INITIALLY NOT DEFINED.
